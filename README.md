# MEMORY - GAME - PROJECT
This project is a classic memory game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game presents a grid of cards faced down, and the player's objective is to find matching pairs by flipping them over. It tests the player's memory and cognitive skills.

**How to Play**
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The game grid will be displayed with all the cards faced down.
Click on any card to reveal its hidden symbol.
Click on another card to reveal its symbol.
If the symbols on the two cards match, they will remain face up. Otherwise, they will be flipped back down.
Continue flipping cards and trying to find all matching pairs.
The game ends when all pairs have been found, and a success message will be displayed.
